# Particle Swarm Optimization
This project was created for COSC 3P71 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at BrockU. The purpose of this assignment was to implement the vanilla particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and compare the performance of various parameter configurations to random search. 

## Introduction 
Particle  swarm  optimization  (PSO)  is  a  population-basedtechnique that has multiple different algorithmic implementa-tions. For this assignment I used the vanilla PSO as required. This  algorithm  is  very  basic  and  focuses  on  the  particles being attracted to the most fit values that they personally have discovered and their neighbourhoodâ€™s global best. This algorithm was used to attempt optimization of the Rastrigin  function while  gathering  data  on  how  different control  parameters  affected  the  outcome  of  these  optimizations. There  was  also  the  need  to  implement  a  random  search algorithm to  aid the comparison  of parameter configurations, and how they allow the PSO to perform better than a random search.
